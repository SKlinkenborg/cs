# Hash Map Methodology

In the case of a map between two things, we don’t really care about the exact sequence of the data. We only care that a given input, when fed into the map, gives the accurate output. Developing a data structure that performs this is tricky because computers care much more about values than relationships. A computer doesn’t really care to memorize the astrological signs of all of our friends, so we need to trick the computer into caring.

Let’s say that the number we correspond with the name “Joan McNeil” is 17. We find the 17th index of the array we’re using to store our map and save the value (Libra) there.

How did we get 17, though? We use a special function that turns data like the string
“Joan McNeil” into a number. This function is called a hashing function, or a hash function. Hashing functions are useful in many domains, but for our data structure the most important aspect is that a hashing function returns an array index as output.
